    <p>We've been together for 6 months now my love. Time flies so fast with you. Think about it, during this 6 months, we went through a lot. We both had fun, we did cute things, we went on dates,we fought, we argued, we fixed and we stayed. We still have long way to go darling. I promise.. I will never leave you or get bored of you. Sometimes I may be hard to understand and I might make you mad but please know that I love you so much. I really do. You need to trust me with this. And I believe that the same goes for you too. Please don't hate me or leave me. You are the only good thing I have now. I want to build my future and go through everything with you. I want us to be happy. And thank you for everything you did for me. I appreciate those every little things you did to make me happy. Thank you Ko. I really mean it. You are the best gift I've ever received from god. I love you.
      <p>Also this is my gift for our anni, since I can't afford much..heh. This is the least I can do. I hope you'll love this.</p>
